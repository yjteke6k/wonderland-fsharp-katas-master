Alice found herself very tiny and wandering around Wonderland.  Even
the grass around her seemed like a maze.

This is a tiny maze solver.

A maze is represented by a 2D array

```fsharp
val maze3x3 : Cell [,] = [[Start; Empty; Wall]
                          [Wall; Empty; Wall]
                          [Wall; Empty; Exit]]
```


The goal is the get to the end of the maze.  A solved maze will have a
_X_ in the start, the path, and the end of the maze, and _O_ otherwise, like this.

```fsharp
val solution3x3 : Path [,] = [[X; X; O]
                              [O; X; O]
                              [O; X; X]]
```
