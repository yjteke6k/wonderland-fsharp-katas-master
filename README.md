## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. All the katas are located in the folder `/wonderland-fsharp-katas/`. Each kata is an independent, self-contained F# script, and a companion instructions file (for example, alphabet-cipher.fsx and alphabet-cipher.md). Read the instructions, open the script file in your favorite editor or IDE, select all the code (<kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>) and execute it (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) - and fix the code until the tests pass.

Before running any of the katas, you will need to download some dependencies, using [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/). Once your have cloned or forked the project, `cd .paket`, and run first `paket.bootstrapper.exe`, then `paket.exe install` to install the dependencies.

If you don't have F# installed yet, follow the instructions from the **use** section of [**fsharp.org**](http://www.fsharp.org).
